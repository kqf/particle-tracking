# particle-tracking [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/kqf/particle-tracking.svg?token=7bkqqhrPB19pD1YKrAZM&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/kqf/particle-tracking)

[Particle tracking competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification/) is a good challenge for clustering algorithms.
The associated dataset is huge, therefore it's good for self-learning/explorations. No submission has been made due to limited CPU resources.
